    <string name="definition">Flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing.  <br /> <br /> The process of drawing a flowchart for an algorithm is known as “flowcharting”</string>
    <string name="gdg_description_terminal"><b>1. Terminal:</b> The oval symbol indicates Start, Stop and Halt in a program’s logic flow. A pause/halt is generally used in a program logic under some error conditions. Terminal is the first and last symbols in the flowchart.</string>
    <string name="input_output"><b>2. Input/Output:</b> A parallelogram denotes any function of input/output type. Program instructions that take input from input devices and display output on output devices are indicated with parallelogram in a flowchart. "</string>
    <string name="process"><b>3. Processing:</b> A box represents arithmetic instructions. All arithmetic processes such as adding, subtracting, multiplication and division are indicated by action or process symbol.</string>
    <string name="decision"><b>4. Decision:</b> Diamond symbol represents a decision point. Decision based operations such as yes/no question or true/false are indicated by diamond in flowchart. "</string>
    <string name="connectors"><b>5. Connectors:</b> Whenever flowchart becomes complex or it spreads over more than one page, it is useful to use connectors to avoid any confusions. It is represented by a circle. "</string>
